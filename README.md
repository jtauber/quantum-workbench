In the first lecture of MIT's 8.04 Quantum Physics I (Spring 2013), Allan Adams
takes his students through a series of experiments based on Chapter 1 of David
Albert's *Quantum Mechanics and Experience*.

This is (the beginnings of) an attempt to implement these experiments firstly
in Python to get the algorithms right and then eventually in Javascript to run
in a browser.
